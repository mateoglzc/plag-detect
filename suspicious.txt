The headdress is a well-known symbol of indigenous America, forming part of the narrative of the wild west and cowboys and Indians . One of the most famous examples of this narrative is the Battle of Little Bighorn.

On June 25, 1876, Lt. Colonel George Custer led a unit of 210 men of the U.S. Army’s 7th Cavalry against thousands of Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne warriors . Custer and his men were handily defeated, and Americans have always remembered the battle as Custer’s Last Stand. However, sometimes lost to history are the difficult decisions tribal leaders made afterward in seeking to protect their people, especially those most vulnerable .
